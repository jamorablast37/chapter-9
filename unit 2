Programming Exercise 9-2
Author: Cosmin Iancu
Instructions
Write a program that reads students’ names followed by their test scores. The
program should output each student’s name followed by the test scores and the
relevant grade. It should also find and print the highest test score and the
name of the students having the highest test score.
Student data should be stored in a struct variable of type studentType, which
has four components: studentFName and studentLName of type string, testScore of
type int (testScore is between 0 and 100), and grade of type char. Suppose that
the class has 20 students. Use an array of 20 components of type studentType.
Your program must contain at least the following functions:
A function to read the students’ data into the array.
A function to assign the relevant grade to each student.
A function to find the highest test score.
A function to print the names of the students having the highest test score.
Your program must output each student’s name in this form: last name followed
by a comma, followed by a space, followed by the first name; the name must be
left justified. Moreover, other than declaring the variables and opening the
input and output files, the function main should only be a collection of
function calls.
Your program should accept no input and save the output to Ch9_Ex2Out.txt.
